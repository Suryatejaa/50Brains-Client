# Work History Service Migration Summary

## Overview

The work-history backend service has been decommissioned and replaced with a new endpoint from the gig service. This document outlines the changes made to migrate the frontend to use the new API.

## New API Endpoint

```
GET /api/gig/work-history/applicant/{applicantId}
```

### Response Structure

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "string",
            "applicationId": "string",
            "gigId": "string",
            "applicantId": "string",
            "gigOwnerId": "string",
            "gigPrice": "string",
            "quotedPrice": "string",
            "appliedAt": "ISO8601",
            "acceptedAt": "ISO8601",
            "rejectedAt": "ISO8601",
            "applicationStatus": "PENDING|APPROVED|REJECTED|CLOSED",
            "workSubmittedAt": "ISO8601",
            "workReviewedAt": "ISO8601",
            "submissionStatus": "PENDING|APPROVED|REJECTED",
            "completedAt": "ISO8601",
            "paidAt": "ISO8601",
            "paymentAmount": "string",

            "withdrawnAt": "ISO8601",
            "withdrawalReason": "string",
            "revisionCount": number,
            "lastActivityAt": "ISO8601",
            "createdAt": "ISO8601",
            "updatedAt": "ISO8601"
        }
    ],
    "pagination": {
        "total": number,
        "limit": number,
        "offset": number
    }
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `gig-api.ts`

- Added new method `getWorkHistoryForApplicant(applicantId: string)` to the GigAPI class
- This method calls the new gig service endpoint

### 2. Updated `work-history-api.ts`

- **Replaced `getUserSummary()`**: Now uses the new gig service endpoint instead of the decommissioned work-history service
- **Enhanced data transformation**: Transforms gig service data to match expected component interfaces
- **Calculated metrics**: Generates work summary statistics from the raw gig data
- **Added fallback data**: Provides reasonable defaults for missing fields

#### Data Transformation Highlights:

- **Work Summary**: Calculated from gig application data
  - `totalProjects`: Total number of applications
  - `completedProjects`: Applications with `submissionStatus === 'APPROVED'`
  - `activeProjects`: Applications with `applicationStatus === 'APPROVED'` but not completed
  - `totalEarnings`: Sum of `quotedPrice` for approved submissions
  - `successRate`: Percentage of successful completions

- **Work Records**: Transformed application data to match WorkRecord interface
  - Enhanced titles based on application/submission status
  - Added computed fields for better UX
  - Preserved original gig service fields for debugging

- **Skills & Achievements**: Provides fallback data since not available from gig service
  - Default skills: "Communication", "Quality Work", "Timely Delivery"
  - Generated achievements based on project completion milestones

### 3. Updated Reputation System

- **`getUserReputation()`**: Now generates reputation data from work history
- Calculates scores based on completed projects
- Provides tier levels (BRONZE/SILVER/GOLD) based on completion count
- Includes ranking and metrics computed from gig data

### 4. Updated Portfolio System

- **`getUserPortfolio()`**: Generates portfolio items from completed projects
- Creates portfolio entries for each approved submission
- Includes work context and project details

### 5. Fixed TypeScript Issues

- Updated `useWorkHistory.ts` to handle new Promise return types
- Added proper type casting for API responses
- Resolved all compilation errors

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Consolidated Data Source**: All work-related data now comes from the gig service
2. **Real-time Accuracy**: Data is always up-to-date with actual gig applications and submissions
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Eliminates dependency on separate work-history service
4. **Enhanced Metrics**: Better calculation of success rates and earnings based on actual gig data
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing components continue to work without changes

## Data Mapping

| Original Field | New Source       | Notes                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| workHistory    | gig applications | Transformed from application/submission data    |
| workSummary    | calculated       | Computed from gig data metrics                  |
| skills         | fallback         | Default skills provided (can be enhanced later) |
| achievements   | generated        | Based on completion milestones                  |
| reputation     | calculated       | Computed from project success metrics           |
| portfolio      | generated        | Created from completed projects                 |

## Status Mapping

| Application Status | Submission Status | Display Status  | Description                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| PENDING            | null              | pending         | Application under review               |
| APPROVED           | null              | approved        | Application accepted, work not started |
| APPROVED           | PENDING           | in_progress     | Work submitted, under review           |
| APPROVED           | APPROVED          | completed       | Work completed and approved            |
| APPROVED           | REJECTED          | revision_needed | Work needs revision                    |
| REJECTED           | null              | rejected        | Application rejected                   |
| CLOSED             | APPROVED          | completed       | Project closed successfully            |

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Dashboard Components**: Verify all dashboard cards display correct metrics
2. **Work History List**: Ensure projects show with proper status indicators
3. **Portfolio Display**: Check that completed projects appear in portfolio
4. **Achievement System**: Verify achievements are generated correctly
5. **Performance**: Monitor API response times with new endpoint

## Future Enhancements

1. **Skills Integration**: Enhance skills data when gig service provides skill information
2. **Client Feedback**: Integrate actual client ratings when available
3. **Category Mapping**: Map gig categories to work categories
4. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket updates for work status changes
5. **Advanced Metrics**: Add more sophisticated analytics based on gig data

## Migration Complete

✅ All API endpoints updated  
✅ Data transformation implemented  
✅ TypeScript errors resolved  
✅ Components maintain compatibility  
✅ Development server running successfully

The migration is complete and the application should now work with the new gig service endpoint for all work history functionality.
