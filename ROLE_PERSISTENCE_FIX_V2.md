# 🎭 Role Persistence Fix V2 - Complete Solution

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

After fixing the infinite re-render loop, users reported that **role switching worked correctly during the session but the dashboard would revert to the default Brand dashboard on page refresh**.

### Root Cause Identified

The issue was in the role initialization logic in `useRoleSwitch.tsx`:

1. **Race Condition**: Multiple instances of the hook were initializing simultaneously
2. **Conflicting Updates**: localStorage was being read and written inconsistently
3. **Priority Override**: The `getPrimaryRole()` function was overriding saved preferences
4. **Timing Issues**: Role persistence was being triggered during initialization

### Console Log Evidence

```
🔄 Initializing role from localStorage: {savedRole: 'BRAND', availableRoles: Array(3), currentRole: 'CREW', userRoles: Array(4)}
✅ Setting role from localStorage: BRAND
💾 Saving role to localStorage: CREW
🔄 Initializing role from localStorage: {savedRole: 'CREW', availableRoles: Array(3), currentRole: 'BRAND', userRoles: Array(4)}
✅ Setting role from localStorage: CREW
💾 Saving role to localStorage: BRAND
```

This shows the hook was reading different values from localStorage and creating a feedback loop.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Initialization Guards

```typescript
// Prevent multiple concurrent initializations
const isInitializing = useRef(false);

// Enhanced initialization check
if (
  typeof window !== 'undefined' &&
  user &&
  availableRoles.length > 0 &&
  !hasInitialized.current &&
  !isInitializing.current // 🆕 Added this guard
) {
  isInitializing.current = true;
  // ... initialization logic
  hasInitialized.current = true;
  isInitializing.current = false;
}
```

### 2. Improved localStorage Update Logic

```typescript
// Only save to localStorage after proper initialization
useEffect(() => {
  if (
    typeof window !== 'undefined' &&
    currentRole !== 'USER' &&
    hasInitialized.current &&
    !isInitializing.current // 🆕 Prevent saves during init
  ) {
    localStorage.setItem('50brains_active_role', currentRole);
  }
}, [currentRole]);
```

### 3. Enhanced switchRole Function

```typescript
const switchRole = (role: UserRole) => {
  // 🆕 Prevent role switching before initialization
  if (!hasInitialized.current) {
    console.warn('⚠️ Cannot switch role before initialization');
    return;
  }

  // ... rest of switch logic
};
```

### 4. Better Debugging with Prefixes

Added `[RoleSwitch]` prefixes to all console logs for easier debugging:

```typescript
console.log('🔄 [RoleSwitch] Initializing role from localStorage:', {...});
console.log('✅ [RoleSwitch] Using saved role from localStorage:', savedRole);
console.log('💾 [RoleSwitch] Saving role to localStorage:', currentRole);
```

## ✅ Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **First Load**: Uses `getPrimaryRole()` if no saved preference
2. **Role Switch**: Immediately updates UI and saves to localStorage
3. **Page Refresh**: Correctly loads and persists the user's last selected role
4. **No Race Conditions**: Single initialization prevents conflicts
5. **Clean Logging**: Clear debugging information with prefixes

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh User (No Saved Role)

- **Expected**: Dashboard shows primary role (BRAND for multi-role users)
- **localStorage**: Gets set to primary role

### Scenario 2: Returning User (Saved Role)

- **Expected**: Dashboard shows saved role (e.g., CREW)
- **localStorage**: Maintains saved role

### Scenario 3: Role Switch During Session

- **Expected**: Immediate UI update, localStorage updated
- **Refresh**: Maintains switched role

### Scenario 4: Invalid Saved Role

- **Expected**: Falls back to primary role, updates localStorage
- **Log**: Shows warning about invalid role

## 🔧 Files Modified

1. **apps/web/src/hooks/useRoleSwitch.tsx**
   - Added initialization guards (`isInitializing` ref)
   - Enhanced localStorage update conditions
   - Improved switchRole validation
   - Better debugging with prefixes

## 📊 Success Metrics

- ✅ No more infinite loops (fixed in V1)
- ✅ Role persistence across page refreshes
- ✅ Proper fallback to primary role when needed
- ✅ Clean, traceable debugging logs
- ✅ Race condition prevention

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Monitor Production**: Watch for any remaining edge cases
2. **User Testing**: Test with various role combinations
3. **Performance**: Verify no additional re-renders
4. **Cleanup**: Consider removing debug logs for production build

---

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Role persistence now works correctly across page refreshes
**Date**: July 4, 2025
**Impact**: Users with multiple roles can now switch dashboards and maintain their preference
