## 🏗️ **CURRENT ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**

### **State Management Strategy**

```typescript
// Client State: Zustand stores for UI state, preferences, cached data
// Server State: React Query for API data, caching, synchronization
// Form State: React Hook Form with Zod validation

interface AppStores {
  auth: AuthStore; // User authentication, permissions
  ui: UIStore; // Theme, modals, sidebar state
  preferences: PrefStore; // User preferences, settings
}

// React Query for all API operations with smart caching
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      gcTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
      retry: 3,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    },
  },
});
```

### **Component Architecture**

```typescript
// Atomic Design Pattern
components/
├── atoms/           # Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Icon)
├── molecules/       # Simple combinations (SearchBox, UserCard)
├── organisms/       # Complex combinations (Header, GigList)
├── templates/       # Page layouts
└── pages/           # Complete pages

// Feature-based organization for complex features
features/
├── auth/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── stores/
│   └── types/
├── gigs/
├── clans/
└── credits/
```

### **API Client Strategy**

```typescript
// Optimistic UI with stale-while-revalidate pattern
class OptimisticAPIClient {
  // Return cached data immediately
  // Fetch fresh data in background
  // Update UI when fresh data arrives
  // Handle conflicts gracefully
}

// Error handling with user-friendly messages
class ErrorHandler {
  // Map API errors to user messages
  // Retry logic for transient failures
  // Fallback UI for permanent failures
}
```
