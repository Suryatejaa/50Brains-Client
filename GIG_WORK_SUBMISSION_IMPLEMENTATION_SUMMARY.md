## API Integration

### **GigAPI Methods Added/Enhanced**:
```typescript
// Existing methods (already implemented):
- createSubmission(data: CreateSubmissionData): Promise<Submission>
- updateSubmission(submissionId: string, data: Partial<CreateSubmissionData>): Promise<Submission>
- getGigSubmissions(gigId: string): Promise<Submission[]>
- approveSubmission(submissionId: string, rating?: number, feedback?: string): Promise<Submission>
- rejectSubmission(submissionId: string, feedback: string): Promise<Submission>
- requestRevision(submissionId: string, feedback: string): Promise<Submission>

// New method added:
- getMySubmissions(queryParams?: string): Promise<{ submissions: Submission[]; pagination: any }>
```

## User Workflows

### **Creator Workflow**:
1. **Apply to Gig**: User applies to a gig through existing application system
2. **Get Approved**: Brand approves the application
3. **Complete Work**: User completes the assigned work
4. **Submit Work**: User clicks "Submit Completed Work" button
5. **Fill Form**: User fills out submission form with:
   - Title and description
   - Deliverables list
   - Additional notes
6. **Submit**: Work is submitted for brand review
7. **Track Status**: User can view submission status in "My Submissions"

### **Brand Workflow**:
1. **Receive Submission**: Brand receives work submission notification
2. **Review Work**: Brand reviews submitted work through submissions page
3. **Provide Feedback**: Brand provides rating and feedback
4. **Take Action**: Brand can:
   - **Approve**: Work is approved, credits awarded, work history created
   - **Reject**: Work is rejected, gig returns to assigned status
   - **Request Revision**: Work needs changes, gig returns to in-progress

## Status Management

### **Submission Statuses**:
- **PENDING**: Work submitted, awaiting review
- **APPROVED**: Work approved, payment processed
- **REJECTED**: Work rejected, needs resubmission
- **REVISION**: Work needs changes before approval

### **Gig Status Flow**:
```
ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → SUBMITTED → COMPLETED
                ↑           ↓
            REVISION ← REJECTED
```

## UI/UX Features

### **Responsive Design**:
- Mobile-first approach
- Responsive modals and forms
- Touch-friendly interface elements

### **User Experience**:
- Clear status indicators with icons
- Intuitive form validation
- Helpful error messages
- Success confirmations
- Progress tracking

### **Accessibility**:
- Proper form labels
- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly

## Integration Points

### **Existing Systems**:
- **Authentication**: Uses existing `useAuth` hook
- **Role Management**: Integrates with `useRoleSwitch` hook
- **API Client**: Uses existing `apiClient` infrastructure
- **Toast Notifications**: Uses existing toast system
- **Routing**: Integrates with Next.js routing

### **Data Flow**:
1. User submits work → `WorkSubmissionForm` component
2. Form data → `GigAPI.createSubmission()` → Backend API
3. Backend processes → Updates gig status → Creates submission record
4. Brand reviews → `GigAPI.approveSubmission()` → Backend API
5. Backend processes → Awards credits → Creates work history → Updates status

## Security & Validation

### **Frontend Validation**:
- Required field validation
- Data format validation
- User permission checks
- Role-based access control

### **Backend Integration**:
- API authentication
- User permission verification
- Data sanitization
- Rate limiting (handled by backend)

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**:
1. **File Uploads**: Support for file attachments in submissions
2. **Revision System**: Enhanced revision workflow with version tracking
3. **Notifications**: Real-time submission status updates
4. **Analytics**: Submission performance metrics
5. **Bulk Actions**: Batch approval/rejection for multiple submissions

### **Technical Improvements**:
1. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time status updates
2. **Offline Support**: Offline form submission with sync
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Date range, gig category filtering
4. **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF export of submissions
5. **Search & Sort**: Advanced search and sorting capabilities

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### **Component Testing**:
- Form validation testing
- User interaction testing
- Error handling testing
- Responsive design testing

### **Integration Testing**:
- API integration testing
- User workflow testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile device testing

## Deployment Considerations
